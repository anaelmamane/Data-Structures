Program:

Look for cases on a specific date
> Use a map with key being date and value being vector of cases
> And for comparison we could use an AVL (sorted by date) which 
  initially searches for the date



Look for cases based on age:
> Iterate through whole AVL tree and print/save the Cases that match
To see risk, iterate through previous vector and see percentage of
deaths/hospitalizations


Look for cases based on race:
> Iterate through whole AVL tree and print/save the Cases that match


Look for cases base one race and age:
> Make a map with key being race+age and a value which is a vector of
Cases. Find percentage of hospitalization/death. among each key
