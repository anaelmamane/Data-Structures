Program:

Look for cases on a specific date
> Use an AVL tree with the key being a date. The key is composed of
integers month, day. The user will input a date, and all cases on that
date we be output. Each "Node" of the AVL Tree will be a vector that holds
all cases on that date.
Options:
Check hospitalizations
Check death rate

Look for cases based on age:
> Iterate through whole AVL tree and print/save the Cases that match
To see risk, iterate through previous vector and see percentage of
deaths/hospitalizations


Look for cases based on race:
> Iterate through whole AVL tree and print/save the Cases that match


Look for cases base one race and age:
> Make a map with key being race+age and a value which is a vector of
Cases. Find percentage of hospitalization/death among each vector
